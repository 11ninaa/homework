    <h1>My name is <br><span>Nina Anakieva</span></h1>
    <p class="parr">I was born on December 25, 2004 in Vinica, Macedonia. Growing up, I developed a deep love for reading books,
      which opened up new worlds and perspectives for me. This passion continues to enrich my life today.
      Alongside reading, I have a strong wanderlust for traveling and discovering different cultures. Exploring new
      places not only satisfies my curiosity but also broadens my understanding of the world. I cherish spending
      time with my friends, whether it's engaging in meaningful conversations or simply enjoying each other's company. </p>
